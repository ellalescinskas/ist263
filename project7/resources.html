            <h2>My Personal Volunteer Story</h2>
            <div class="story-container">
                <p>
                    Growing up, I have been involved with the nonprofit Best Buddies International, an organization close to my heart. I have taken part in their Friendship Programs since a young age, getting matched with an individual with IDD to foster a meaningful friendship. This program helps break down social barriers and promotes inclusion in our world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I volunteer for the Martin Richard Foundation Challenger Sports Program. In this program, you are matched with a young adult or child with developmental or physical disabilities and teach them how to play various sports. This campaign is very special to me and a great way I can get involved in my community in Boston, MA. Taking part in these volunteer opportunities has led me to create life-long friendships and connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only has it benefited me socially, but it has led me to discover new passions and strengths I never knew I had. I’ve gained valuable leadership skills by teaching sports and advocating for inclusion. Ultimately, my time volunteering has shaped my perspective and motivated me to advocate for others!
